# Eric Larkin
## CS1520 Project 1 Proposal



#### Technologies/Languages to use:
* PHP
* MySQL
* HTML
* JavaScript
* jQuery

<br>
#### Frontend framework
* Bootstrap

<br>
#### Site idea:

Considering I do not have one and have considered building one for quite some time, I'm going to create a personal website to share my skills and experience. I imagine displaying my resume, my personal and professional interests, contact forms, links to my social media, coding tutorials (or other realated technology blog-ish posts). Much of the data, such as my interests, links, bio, and blog post information will be stored in a database, hence the need for MySQL. Previously, I have used Foundation for web projects. Therefore, I chose to use Bootstrap in order to learn something new. I have extensive jQuery experience, so I will utilize that here rather than using JavaScript at all times.

<br>
#### Questions:
1. If I setup a MySQL database locally (using apache), how do we turn it in? 
2. Considering I have some PHP experience, I'd like to use it here. However, considering we will have not covered it yet in class (or not much), will we be graded on proper conventions?
3. Does it have to be responsive/does it matter which browser(s) it renders 100% correctly in?
